# Mp5: Deep Reinforcement Learning CS 444 2024

## **Overview**
This assignment involves implementing **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** and **Double DQN** to train an agent to play **Atari Breakout** using deep reinforcement learning. The agent interacts with raw pixel observations from OpenAI Gym.

### **Goals:**
1. Implement and train a **DQN** agent to reach a mean score of **8**.
2. Implement and train a **Double DQN** agent to reach a mean score of **10**.
